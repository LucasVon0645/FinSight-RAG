      "*   **EBITDA/EBITDA Margin:** Crucial for assessing core operational profitability, especially given high depreciation and potential variability in financing structures.\n",
      "*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Extremely important for funding R&D, capital expenditures (CapEx), and enduring cyclical demand. It shows the cash available after essential investments.\n",
      "*   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) / Return on Assets (ROA):** Measures how efficiently Embraer is generating profits from its substantial asset base (factories, equipment, intellectual property).\n",
      "*   **Order Book/Backlog:** While not a traditional financial ratio, the size and quality of the order book are critical forward-looking indicators of future revenue, production stability, and investor confidence.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **EBITDA/EBITDA Margin:** Highly relevant for comparing operational performance across global oil & gas companies, as it neutralizes differences in depreciation (due to vast assets), interest costs, and tax regimes.\n",
      "*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Critical for an industry with immense CapEx requirements (exploration, production, refining). FCF indicates the company's ability to cover its investments and repay debt.\n",

      "Based on the provided excerpt, a comprehensive comparative summary of the financial performance of Embraer and Petrobras is not possible. The excerpt furnishes detailed financial performance data exclusively for Petrobras, illustrating declines in its latest available figures for profitability (e.g., consolidated net income down by (70.6) % to 36,606, Adjusted EBITDA down by (18.2) % to 214,419), cash flow (free cash flow down by (20.1) % to 124,054, net cash from operating activities down by (5.4) % to 204,037), and revenue (sales revenues down by (4.1) % to 490,829). However, for Embraer, the excerpt only mentions initiatives related to improving operational efficiency and references to its annual report, without providing any specific financial figures related to its profitability, cash flow, or leverage. Therefore, key differences in these financial aspects between the two companies cannot be highlighted from this text.\n"
